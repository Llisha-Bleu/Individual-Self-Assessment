# Individual-Self-Assessment

I put in a lot of work on this project, practically from start to finish I was leading the project, and it became  working tiring a group where I believe members were not carrying their weight, and of course it did nt help my case where one of my group member dropped out after the first week of the project. The weeks leading after that was challenging. I had to do all the ground work, I did all the research and technical work for the project - I created and worked on the model from start to finish, as well as the database without no help from my group member. I also created the dashboard to present the work. Everytime an assignemnt was handed to them, I was met with unfinished work or no work at all - execuses, excuses, excuses.... at the end it was a struggle to finish and left me with a sour taste and nothing but regret but I tried to carry the team as best as possible.
